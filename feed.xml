In this note, our approach will involve a detailed examination of the interplay between the manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) and its ambiant space \(\mathbb{R}^m\). To this end, the symbols \(\Delta_\mathcal{M}\) and \(\nabla_\mathcal{M}\) will be employed to represent the Laplacian and gradient operators on \(\mathcal{M}\), respectively (instead of just \(\Delta\) and \(\nabla\)). This choice is made to prevent any potential confusion in our exposition.</p> <p>In terms of content, this section delves into the path space measures \(\mathbb{P}_{(p,T)}\) on \(\mathcal{M}\), which arise from the differential operator \(\mathcal{L}_p = \Delta_{\mathcal{M}} + \nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln(p)\), meaning \(\mathcal{L}_pf = \Delta_\mathcal{M} f + \langle \nabla_\mathcal{M} f, \nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln(p) \rangle\), over the observation period \(T\). The primary finding can be stated as follows:</p> <p><strong>Proposition</strong> Let \(\mathbb{P}_{(p,T)}\) denote the law of a \(\mathcal{L}_p\)-diffusion process \((X_t, t \in [0,T])\) with inititial distribution being the volume measure \(\mathcal{M}\). Then, for any two \(\mathcal{C}^1\) strictly positive probability \(p\) densities \(p\) and \(q\) on \(\mathcal{M}\),</p> \[\mathrm{KL}(\mathbb{P}_{(p,T)} || \mathbb{P}_{(p,T)} ) \le \frac{p_\max^2}{4} \times T \int_\mathcal{M} \| \nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln p-\nabla_\mathcal{M}\ln q)\|_2^2 \mathrm{vol}(\mathrm{d}x),\] <p>where \(p_\max= \max( \| p\|_\infty, \| q\|_\infty)\) . In particular, with \(p_\min\) being a constant such that \(0&lt;p_\min \le p,q\),</p> \[\mathrm{KL}(\mathbb{P}_{(p,T)} || \mathbb{P}_{(p,T)} ) \le \frac{p_\max^2}{2p_\min^2}\times T \left(\int_\mathcal{M} \| \nabla_\mathcal{M} p\|_2^2 \mathrm{vol}(\mathrm{d}x) +\int_\mathcal{M} \| \nabla_\mathcal{M} q\|_2^2 \mathrm{vol}(\mathrm{d}x)\right).\] <h3 id="premilinaries-zdelta_mathcalm-diffusion-process-as-an-sde-solution-in-mathbbrm">Premilinaries: \((Z+\Delta_\mathcal{M})\)-diffusion process as an SDE solution in \(\mathbb{R}^m\)</h3> <p>Another name for \(\Delta_\mathcal{M}\)-diffusion process is Brownian motion on \(\mathcal{M}\). Thus for any \(\mathcal{C}^1\) vector field \(Z: \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m\) tangent to \(\mathcal{M}\), the \((Z+\Delta_\mathcal{M})\) -diffusion process can also be seen as a Brownian process with non-zero drift term. This is short note, we give a premilinary on a geometric method to write an \((Z+\Delta_\mathcal{M})\)-diffusion process \((X_t)\) as a solution to an SDE in \(\mathbb{R}^m\). Based on this representation, we formulate a compact Girsanov-type result formula for \((X_t)\). Interested readers are encouraged to read Chapter 3 in Hsu2002 for a beautiful and well-written introduction to Brownian motion on manifolds by Hsu.</p> <p>Let \(E_1, E_2,..., E_m: \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m\) be the standard orthonormal basis of \(\mathbb{R}^m\). For any \(x \in \mathcal{M}\) and \(i\), we let \(V_i(x)\) denote the the projection of \(E_1(x)\) on the tangent vector space of \(\mathcal{M}\) at point \(x\). By tubular neightborhood theorem (Theorem 6.24 , p.139, Lee smooth), Theorem 3.1.4 in Hsu can be formulated as follows:</p> <p><strong>Lemma</strong> (an Hörmander’s representation of \(\Delta_\mathcal{M}\)) (Theorem 3.1.4 in Hsu) There is an open neighborhood \(U\) of \(\mathcal{M}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^m\) such that the family of vector fields \(V_i\)(x) can be extended to some smooth family of vector fields (also denoted by \(V_i\)) on \(U\) such that on \(\mathcal{M}\)</p> \[\Delta_\mathcal{M}= V_1^2+ V_2^2+\cdots +V_m^2,\] <p>In other words, \(\Delta_\mathcal{M}= \sum_{i=1}^m V_i( V_i(f))\). Thus, for any \(\mathcal{C}^1\) extension \(\tilde{Z}\) of \(Z\), any solution \((X_t)\) of the SDE:</p> \[\mathrm{d} X_t= \tilde{Z}(X_t)\mathrm{d}t + \sqrt{2}\sum_{i=1}^m V_i\circ \mathrm{d} B^i_t, \qquad X_0 = x_0 \in \mathcal{M},\] <p>is also an \((Z+\Delta_\mathcal{M})\) diffusion process (c.f. Chapter 1 Hsu), with \(B\) being a standard \(m\)-dimensional Brownian motion) and \(\circ\) denote the Stratonovich integral</p> <p><em>Remark:</em> In general, the solution \((X_t)\) will no longer stay on the manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) if we replace the Stratonovich integral by Ito integral. For example, the Stratonovich SDE for the Brownian motion on circle \(X_t=\begin{bmatrix} \cos(B_t) \\ \sin(B_t) \end{bmatrix}\) is</p> \[\mathrm{d} X_t= \begin{bmatrix} -X^2_t \\ X^1_t \end{bmatrix} \circ \mathrm{d} B_t,\] <p>with Ito SDE representation:</p> \[\mathrm{d} X_t= -\frac{1}{2} X_t \mathrm{d} t+ \begin{bmatrix} -X^2_t \\ X^1_t \end{bmatrix} \mathrm{d} B_t.\] <p>whereas, the solution for the Ito SDE \(\mathrm{d} Y_t= \begin{bmatrix} -Y^2_t \\ Y^1_t \end{bmatrix} \mathrm{d} B_t\) is \(Y_t= e^{t/2 } X_t\), which clearly goes to infinity when \(t\) goes to infinity.</p> <p>Besides, for any \(x \in \mathcal{M}\) and any vector \(v\) tangent to \(\mathcal{M}\) at \(x\), due to the linearity of tangent projection, \(v\) can be rewritten</p> \[v= v^i V_1(x)+ v^2 V_2(x)+\cdots+ v^m V_m(x),\] <p>with \(v=(v^1,...,v^m)\).</p> <p>Thus by Girsanov’s theorem, we then can easily prove the following result, which is important for our proof of KL divergence estimation.</p> <p><strong>Proposition</strong> Consider two continuous tangent vector fields \(Z_1,Z_2\) that are tangent to a compact manifold \(\mathcal{M}\). Suppose that \((X_t)\) satisfies the Stratonobich SDE:</p> \[\mathrm{d} X_t= Z_2(X_t)\mathrm{d}t + \sqrt{2}\sum_{i=1}^m V_i \circ \mathrm{d}B^i_t, \qquad X_0 = x_0 \in \mathcal{M},\] <p>where \(B\) is a \(m\)-dimensional standard Brownian motion under \(\mathbb{P}\), \((V_i)\) are the tangent vector field previously defined in this section. (i.e. the tangent project of standard basis of \(\mathbb{R}^m\) on \(\mathcal{M}\)) Then for any \(T&gt;0\) finite, with \(\mathcal{E}_T=\exp \left( - \int_0^T \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(Z_2-Z_1)(X_t)\mathrm{d}B_t +\frac{1}{4} \int_0^t \|Z_1(X_t)-Z_2(X_t) \|^2_2 \mathrm{d} t\right)\) , it follows that:</p> \[\mathbb{E}( \mathcal{E}_T)=1\] <p>and under \(\mathrm{d} \mathbb{Q}= \mathcal{E}_T \mathrm{d} \mathbb{P}\), \((X_t)\) is a solution to the SDE:</p> \[\mathrm{d} X_t= Z_1(X_t)\mathrm{d}t + \sqrt{2}\sum_{i=1}^m V_i \circ \mathrm{d}\tilde{B}^i_t, \qquad X_0 = x_0 \in \mathcal{M},\] <p>with \(\tilde{B}\) is a Brownian motion under \(\mathbb{Q}\).</p> <p><em>Proof</em> The first part follows from the fact that \(\int_0^t (Z_2-Z_1)(X_t) \mathrm{d}B_t\) is a local martingale with bounded quadratic variation (\(Z_i\) are continuous, \(\mathcal{M}\) is compact, hence \(Z_i\) is bounded on \(\mathcal{M}\) ). For the second part, by Girsanov’s theorem, under \(\mathbb{Q}\), the stochastic process \((\hat{B}_t , 0 \le t \le T)\) defined by:</p> \[\tilde{B}_t = B_t + \int_0^t u(X_t) \mathrm{d}t\] <p>is a standard Brownian motion, with \(u(x)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (Z_2-Z_1)(x)\). Besides, the Stratonvich SDE of \(X_t\) can be rewritten as:</p> \[\begin{align*}\mathrm{d} X_t&amp;= Z_2(X_t)\mathrm{d}t + \sqrt{2}\sum_{i=1}^m V_i \circ \mathrm{d}B^i_t=Z_2(X_t)\mathrm{d}t + \sqrt{2}\sum_{i=1}^m V_i \circ \left(\mathrm{d}\tilde{B}^i_t - u(X_t)\mathrm{d}t \right)\\ &amp;=\sqrt{2}\sum_{i=1}^m V_i \circ \mathrm{d}\tilde{B}^i_t+(Z_2-\sum_{i=1}^m \sqrt{2}u^iV_i) \mathrm{d} t=Z_1(X_t)\mathrm{d}t + \sqrt{2}\sum_{i=1}^m V_i \circ \mathrm{d}\tilde{B}^i_t, \end{align*}\] <p>Hence, the conclusion.</p> <h3 id="proof-of-proposition">Proof of Proposition</h3> <p>Clearly, the second inequality follows directly from the first by noticing that \(\nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln(f)= \frac{ \nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln(f)}{f}\). For the first, let \(X\) be a solution to the SDE:</p> \[\mathrm{d} X_t= \nabla_\mathcal{M}\ln p(X_t)\mathrm{d}t + \sqrt{2}\sum_{i=1}^m V_i \mathrm{d}B^i_t, \qquad X_0 \sim \mathrm{vol}_\mathcal{M} ,\] <p>with \(B\) being a \(m\)-dimensional standard Brownian motion under some probability space \(\mathbb{P}\). By Proposition X, \((X_t, t \in [0,T])\) is also a solution to the SDE :</p> \[\mathrm{d} X_t= \nabla_\mathcal{M}\ln q(X_t)\mathrm{d}t + \sqrt{2}\sum_{i=1}^m V_i \mathrm{d}\tilde{B}^i_t, \qquad X_0 \sim \mathrm{vol}_\mathcal{M} ,\] <p>where \((\tilde{B})\) is a \(m\)-dimensional standard Brownian motion under \(\mathbb{Q}\) defined by \(\frac{ \mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}}{\mathrm{d} \mathbb{P}}= \mathcal{E}_T\) with</p> \[\mathcal{E}_T=\exp\left( -M_T+\frac{1}{2} \langle M \rangle_T\right), \quad M_T=\int_0^T \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\left( \nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln p - \nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln q\right)(X_t)\mathrm{d}t.\] <p>Therefore, by the definition of Kullback-Leibler divergence,</p> \[\mathrm{KL}(\mathbb{P}_{(p,T)}||\mathbb{P}_{(q,T)})=\mathbb{E}\left( \ln \frac{\mathrm{d} \mathbb{Q} }{\mathrm{d} \mathbb{P} } \right) = \mathbb{E}\left( -M_T+\frac{1}{2}\langle M \rangle_T \right)= \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}(\langle M\rangle_T).\] <p>Besides,\(p \le p_\max\) and \(p\) is the invariant measure of \(\mathcal{L}_p\), we have:</p> \[\begin{align*} \mathbb{E}(\langle M\rangle_T) &amp; \le p_\max \mathbb{E}_p(\langle M \rangle_T)= p_\max T \int_\mathcal{M} \|\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( \nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln(p) - \nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln(q) \|^2_2 p \mathrm{d} \mathrm{vol}_\mathcal{M} \\ &amp; \le \frac{1}{2}T p_\max^2 \int_\mathcal{M} \| \nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln(p) - \nabla_\mathcal{M} \ln(q) \|^2_2 \mathrm{d} \mathrm{vol}_\mathcal{M}, \end{align*}\] <p>Therefore, we have the desired conclusion.</p> <p><em>Remark</em>: We may also use local charts to construct the corresponding SDEs for each diffusion measure. This approach has the advantage that we do not need to worry about the invertibility of the volatility term in the SDE, which is often a condition in some versions of the Girsanov theorem. (In our above proof, we have avoided this issue by implicitly decomposing the drift term in the SDE into the product of the volatility term with a weightvector). However, this method can make the solution more troublesome due to two points: the locality of the charts (which often leads to the need to add stopping times in the SDE expression), and the cubersomness of the local representations of \(\nabla_\mathcal{M}\) and \(\Delta_\mathcal{M}\). For example,</p> \[\Delta_\mathcal{M} f=\frac{1}{\sqrt{|g|}} \partial_i \left( \sqrt{|g|} g^{ij} \partial_j f \right).\]]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="math"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Consider a compact \(d\)-dimensional submanifold \(\mathcal{M}\) of \(\mathbb{R}^m\).
